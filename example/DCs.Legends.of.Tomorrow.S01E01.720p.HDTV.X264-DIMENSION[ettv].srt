1
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:13,965
Please!

2
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,717
Vandal Savage.

3
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,788
An evil dictator blessed
with immortality.

4
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,089
He has achieved what no one

5
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:33,025
in human history ever has.

6
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:36,128
He has conquered the entire planet.

7
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:52,744
What's your name, son?

8
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:58,150
Jonas.

9
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:00,853
Your mother was brave,

10
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,723
just as your father was foolish.

11
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:07,159
Which are you?

12
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:14,666
So you take after your mother?

13
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:20,840
Or not.

14
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:26,345
Caesar. Hitler.

15
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:27,612
Per Degaton.

16
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:30,449
Rank amateurs compared to Savage.

17
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,485
His forces have already claimed
the lives of billions.

18
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:35,354
- THE MASTERS COUNCIL
- And if we possess the means to stop him,

19
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:38,924
and again do nothing,

20
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,560
then their blood is on our hands.

21
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,595
As a Time Master of long standing,

22
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:45,764
you seem to forget our responsibility

23
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:48,868
is to protect the
timeline, not humanity.

24
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,703
You wish to engage in the very
sort of manipulation of time

25
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:53,038
that we are sworn to prevent.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,974
And yet, if we allow
humanity to perish

27
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:56,541
at the hands of evil, then what universe

28
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,043
are we custodians of?

29
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,412
What if, in trying to
save the world from Savage,

30
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:03,349
you make it vulnerable to
another, more terrible despot?

31
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:05,951
We are not warriors, Captain Hunter.

32
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,119
We possess no army.

33
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:09,821
And I'm not asking for one.

34
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:13,825
Just a single timeship

35
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:15,361
and your permission to change history

36
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:18,330
before Vandal Savage puts an end to it.

37
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,132
I'm not appealing to you

38
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:23,135
as Time Masters,

39
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:26,505
but as humans, please.

40
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,841
Grant me the authority
to change the timeline

41
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:32,912
just this once.

42
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:34,813
How did the council
meeting go, Captain Hunter?

43
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,481
Exactly as expected, Gideon.

44
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:38,850
- So we are proceeding?
- Indeed.

45
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:40,920
Prepare the Waverider for takeoff.

46
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:42,754
Set a course. United States.

47
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:45,824
Star City. January, 2016.

48
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:48,093
The early second millennium A.D.

49
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:49,295
The golden age of gasoline engines,

50
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:50,662
online pornography,

51
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:52,164
and those silly little smartphones.

52
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,432
What are we going to retrieve, Captain?

53
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,433
Oh, not what.

54
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:55,834
Who.

55
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:57,970
I need you to pull up
some files, Gideon.

56
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:00,306
The eight men and women
who'll be joining us

57
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:03,542
on our little crusade.

58
00:03:03,544 --> 00:03:05,978
You usually prefer to
work alone, Captain.

59
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,247
This time, I'll need a team.

60
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,692
First recruit: Dr. Raymond Palmer.

61
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:23,295
Also known as the Atom.

62
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:26,465
This feels good, being
back in the field.

63
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:27,599
Not that this is a field, but...

64
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:28,834
Ray, are you up for this?

65
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:30,869
Too late to turn back now.

66
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,238
Someone removed the
central processing unit.

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,373
Are you sure?

68
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,707
I designed the computer's CPU,

69
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,209
so, yeah, pretty sure.

70
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:39,144
Well, HIVE would only
remove it if they knew...

71
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:42,281
You had me shrink down and fly
into their secret computer lab?

72
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:44,850
My night's about to get a
whole lot worse, isn't it?

73
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:47,919
Oh, you can take them.

74
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,121
They have guns.

75
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:50,255
You have a super-suit.

76
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:51,490
It's time to start growing.

77
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,026
This is gonna get a little rough.

78
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,938
Oh, I am not one of your adversaries.

79
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:11,011
TIBET 2016

80
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:13,078
Next recruit: Sara Lance.

81
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,180
Former member of the
League of Assassins,

82
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:18,750
also formerly dead.

83
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,946
Let her go.

84
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:28,106
Or what?

85
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:42,474
Miss Lance?

86
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:43,909
Join me for a drink?

87
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:47,479
I have come quite a
long way to meet you.

88
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:49,948
- PITTSBURGH 2016
- Firestorm, the merged super-form

89
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,952
of one Jefferson Jackson and
Professor Martin Stein.

90
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:58,323
Caution, Jefferson,
83% of the chemicals

91
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,260
in this factory are combustible.

92
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:04,129
Yeah, tell that to Rambo.

93
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,865
Thought I told you to be careful.

94
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,405
What's the use of
sharing my intelligence

95
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:14,473
if you won't listen?

96
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,941
Stop bossing me around

97
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,242
like I'm one of your
snot-nosed undergrads.

98
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:18,343
Excuse me.

99
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:19,578
Who are you?

100
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,316
- ST. ROCH 2016
- Kendra Saunders and Carter Hall.

101
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:28,320
The latest reincarnations
of Hawkman and Hawkgirl.

102
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:29,821
Kendra.

103
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:31,957
You, my love, almost got us killed.

104
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,125
Thank you.

105
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:34,359
Your flying is still clumsy,

106
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,427
like a bird just out of the nest...

107
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,661
Well maybe that's because

108
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,430
up until two months
ago, I was a barista,

109
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:40,099
not some damn winged demi-goddess.

110
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,968
Have you two considered
couples counseling?

111
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,870
I hear it's quite popular
in this century.

112
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,840
- CENTRAL CITY 2016
- There seems to be an error, Captain.

113
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,976
These candidates, Leonard
Snart and Mick Rory,

114
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:52,144
are a pair of criminals.

115
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:53,212
There's no error, Gideon.

116
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:54,279
Drop your weapons!

117
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:57,916
Fry, you little piggies!

118
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,786
A minivan? Really, Snart?

119
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,455
Cops'll never hassle a dad

120
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:06,891
buying diapers in the
middle of the night.

121
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,965
- What the...
- Watch it!

122
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:23,875
What a headache!

123
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:25,377
Stein?

124
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,878
What the hell are you doing here?

125
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,980
I'm as ignorant as you, for once.

126
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:30,882
Where are we?

127
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:33,785
Why don't you ask the dude who
knocked us out and kidnapped us?

128
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:35,354
British dude with a flashy thing?

129
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:38,257
- Ring any bells?
- The name's Rip Hunter.

130
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,991
I'm from East London.

131
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:42,994
Oh, and the future.

132
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:44,329
Nice to meet you, Rip.

133
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:46,298
While you were incapacitated,

134
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,400
I may have tampered with your weapons.

135
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:51,069
I've assembled you all
because I need your help.

136
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:52,638
The future of the world is in peril

137
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,906
because of a man by the name

138
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:57,709
of Vandal Savage.

139
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,278
That can't be.

140
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,845
We destroyed him.

141
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,847
Yeah, the Green Arrow and
Flash helped us do it.

142
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,316
And therein lay the problem.

143
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:06,518
Unless you or Mr. Hall
deliver the death blow,

144
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,020
Savage can be restored
from but a single cell.

145
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:10,889
What the hell are you talking about?

146
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:13,858
Vandal is immortal.
Kendra and I reincarnate.

147
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,194
Yeah, I've done that.

148
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,817
And what the hell
does this Randall guy

149
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:17,635
got to do with us?

150
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,330
Vandal.

151
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,831
In the future, he will employ

152
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,667
the evil he's perfected
over his long life,

153
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,602
and the power he has amassed
throughout history,

154
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:27,706
to finally conquer the world.

155
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,509
I've been tasked with assembling
an elite team to stop him.

156
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:31,910
How?

157
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:33,278
To travel through time.

158
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,146
To capture Savage before he grows into

159
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:36,915
the monster he becomes.

160
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,650
You got the wrong guy.

161
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:41,486
- "Hero" ain't on my resume.
- Or mine.

162
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,088
I know it's difficult
for you to fathom,

163
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,424
but where... when I'm from,

164
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,092
the year 2166,

165
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:49,461
you and everyone on this roof

166
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:52,331
aren't just considered heroes...

167
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,634
You're legends.

168
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:58,803
Legends?

169
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:00,539
I... I hate to nitpick,

170
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,375
but doesn't a legend have to be dead?

171
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:05,344
Yeah, see... that's
a deal breaker for me,

172
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,445
so I'm gonna pass.

173
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,746
It's dangerous for any of you

174
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,114
to know too much about your own futures,

175
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:11,550
but I am here because each of you,

176
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:16,154
as individuals, is
destined for greatness.

177
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:19,458
I could get behind that.

178
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,593
And, because if you don't follow me,

179
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:23,662
this is what is in store for your world

180
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:26,465
150 years from now.

181
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,584
I could have chosen any
time and any place.

182
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,051
Of all the people who ever lived,

183
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:48,953
I chose you eight.

184
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:51,623
I certainly hope that you won't let me,

185
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,893
and the world, down.

186
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,034
If your answer is yes,

187
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:06,004
meet me at this address in 36 hours.

188
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:28,296
I had that.

189
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,664
I know.

190
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,999
It's fun to watch you kick and punch

191
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,667
and skewer bad guys, but

192
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,269
I need a minute of your time.

193
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,603
I'm sure Captain Hunter will return me

194
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,406
to the moment I left, but I thought,

195
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,707
you know, just in case, someone
should I know I was gone.

196
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:40,942
We went up against Savage.

197
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:42,444
He does not go down easy.

198
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:43,978
That's why Hunter's recruited a team.

199
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,181
A team that includes
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory.

200
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:49,251
So what do you know
about Captain Hunter?

201
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,420
He's a Time Master
from the 22nd century.

202
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:52,620
It's a little hard to Google.

203
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,856
So you know nothing,

204
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,526
and yet you trust him?

205
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:58,693
I'm as trusting as you are cynical.

206
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,095
Well, I'm cynical,

207
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:01,363
and it's difficult for
me to trust anyone,

208
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:04,299
but that has kept me alive.

209
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,802
I died once.

210
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:10,305
At least, the world thought I did.

211
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:12,474
You know what happened?

212
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,109
Nothing.

213
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:16,111
All the money, all the buildings,

214
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:18,480
all the inventions,

215
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:20,515
the world didn't care.

216
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:23,751
My life, ultimately, didn't matter.

217
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:28,323
Rip is giving me the chance
to help save the world.

218
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,692
I have to take it.

219
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:40,868
Keep your head on a
swivel while you're at it.

220
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,670
206 times.

221
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:45,073
Savage has killed both of us 206 times.

222
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:48,510
Yeah, and I'm not too
eager about making it 207.

223
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:49,877
So what?

224
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,946
You just going to run away?

225
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:54,616
We've tried that before.

226
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:57,352
Look, I know you don't
remember your past lives yet,

227
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,654
but I remember so much of it.

228
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:01,189
God, if you only knew how I loved you,

229
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:03,057
and how much...

230
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:07,629
How much it hurt every time
he took you away from me.

231
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,197
Have you ever stopped to think

232
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,134
that maybe, just maybe, we
can't actually beat him?

233
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,035
But this time we wouldn't
be facing him alone,

234
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:15,903
and we almost defeated
him with help before.

235
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:17,105
Yeah, almost.

236
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:19,608
Kendra, this is our best chance

237
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,544
to stop him forever.

238
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:26,047
The woman I've loved for millennia

239
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:28,316
wouldn't be scared of it.

240
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:32,787
Look.

241
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,756
Past lives we'd fight, argue.

242
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,090
A lot.

243
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:40,928
But we'd settle matters as warriors.

244
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,631
What?

245
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,533
Like I beat you,

246
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:46,568
and you give up this
plan to follow Hunter?

247
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,604
Yeah, except you won't
be able to beat me.

248
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:53,408
But you can absolutely try.

249
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,010
Winner gets to decide, little lady.

250
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,087
I remember when you told Mom and Dad

251
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,323
that you wanted to go to sleepaway camp.

252
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:10,758
This'll be a little different.

253
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,461
Time travel.

254
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:14,796
I can't believe we're talking about it

255
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:16,164
like it's something real.

256
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,932
I know.

257
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,972
I think you should go.

258
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,276
Laurel,

259
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:30,645
I died.

260
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,549
I'm still picking up those pieces.

261
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,618
The Lazarus Pit brought me back,

262
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,986
but it left me with this

263
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:41,656
need to take.

264
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:44,359
To kill.

265
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,794
I'm dangerous.

266
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:48,129
After you died,

267
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:51,633
I needed a channel for my grief.

268
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,168
I found it in becoming the Black Canary.

269
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,405
I found it in you.

270
00:12:57,407 --> 00:13:01,343
For me, being the Canary
was never that positive.

271
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:04,713
Then don't be the Canary.

272
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:05,947
Do what Oliver's been doing.

273
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,816
Do what this Rip Hunter is offering you

274
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:11,185
the chance to do and...

275
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:17,392
Be a hero in the light.

276
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:21,396
Be the White Canary.

277
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,101
Where did you get this?

278
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:30,204
I have a resourceful
friend named Cisco.

279
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:34,609
Where's the mask?

280
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:36,411
You don't need it anymore.

281
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:40,014
You've lived in the shadows long enough.

282
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,286
I can't believe you're thinking of

283
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,120
hooking up with the Englishman.

284
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:48,690
We're thieves. Crooks. Criminals.

285
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,625
I have no desire to save the world.

286
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,861
Especially 100 years after I'm dead.

287
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:57,432
He said across time, Mick.
What about the years before?

288
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,967
Before fingerprints and
surveillance cameras

289
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,236
and DNA analysis.

290
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:04,639
Why did we become criminals?

291
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:07,842
Because we hate working
and we love money.

292
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:10,512
We could steal the Mona Lisa
straight off Da Vinci's easel,

293
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:13,548
snatch the Hope Diamond
before it was discovered.

294
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,817
This is everything we
got into thieving for

295
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,219
in the first place.

296
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:20,822
More than everything.

297
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,026
You want me in, I'm in.

298
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:28,363
But I'm not gonna be anyone's hero.

299
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,555
PROF. MARTIN STEN
DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

300
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:33,802
Jefferson, it's imperative
we remain together

301
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:34,936
for our powers to work.

302
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:36,571
In case you haven't noticed,

303
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,406
I'm still getting used to
the whole powers thing,

304
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:40,174
and now that's you're adding
time travel to the mix...

305
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:42,310
Do you have any idea
what an extraordinary

306
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:43,945
opportunity we've been given?

307
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:46,648
A chance to get murdered
by an immortal psychopath.

308
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,217
No thanks.

309
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:51,686
Look, I'm a 20-year-old auto mechanic.

310
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,457
The world is better off
without me trying to save it.

311
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,793
I don't understand your decision.

312
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,465
But I respect it.

313
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,834
Perhaps I can persuade Mr. Hunter

314
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,503
that he needs my
knowledge as a physicist

315
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:12,173
and not my abilities as Firestorm,

316
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:16,244
so I propose we have a toast

317
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:19,647
to my grand and solo adventure.

318
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,850
To saving the world.

319
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,318
Knock yourself out.

320
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:30,224
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

321
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,751
Professor!

322
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:58,920
This is the place.

323
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:00,588
I think we're being punked.

324
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,157
- Do people still say "punked"?
- No.

325
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,160
I see your buddy threw
himself a going-away party.

326
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,662
Yes, I believe he drank something

327
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:11,132
that didn't quite agree with him.

328
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,000
You don't look too happy to be here.

329
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:14,368
Perceptive.

330
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,939
Well, I see you've
all decided to come.

331
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:20,708
Well then, we can be on our way.

332
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,076
I ain't footing it anywhere.

333
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:23,845
A Time Master's sacred charge

334
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:26,013
is to do no harm to the timeline.

335
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:27,749
Can you imagine what a
timeship would look like

336
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,784
in, say, Victorian England?

337
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:33,721
Holographic indigenous
camouflage projection.

338
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:36,324
Indeed.

339
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:49,871
It's called the Waverider.

340
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:53,174
It's been my ship for over a decade.

341
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,344
Shall we?

342
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,485
Excuse me, would you mind...

343
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:05,854
Thank you.

344
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,215
I bet it uses ionic propulsion.

345
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,482
I doubt that very much,

346
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:25,351
given that even advanced technology

347
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:28,087
wouldn't be able to sustain
an ionic reaction.

348
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,190
It's possible if you
stabilize the quantum flux.

349
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:32,358
You know, we actually covered
this before, Professor Stein,

350
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,727
when I was your student, many moons ago?

351
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:38,064
Perhaps you remember my paper
on subspace field mechanics?

352
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:41,134
I don't remember you, Mr. Palmer.

353
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,805
Whatever you roofied
him with, I'd like some.

354
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:47,240
I did not roofie him.

355
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,675
Oh, I ain't judging.

356
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:52,312
I have never seen
anything like this before.

357
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,746
Neither have I, and considering

358
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:54,914
I have 4,000 years worth of memories,

359
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,482
that's saying something.

360
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:59,385
How does a vessel of this
size function without a crew?

361
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:00,386
I don't need one.

362
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:01,354
I have Gideon.

363
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:02,889
Welcome aboard.

364
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:04,324
I am Gideon,

365
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:06,159
an interactive artificial consciousness

366
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:08,862
programmed to operate this
vessel's critical systems

367
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:11,219
and aid Captain Hunter in his mission.

368
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,365
Captain?

369
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,934
Gideon's been working on
helping me locate Vandal Savage.

370
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:17,136
I thought you said he's pretty
active in the 22nd century.

371
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,392
Perhaps engaging Savage
at the height of his powers

372
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:20,654
isn't the best strategy.

373
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:21,574
Indeed.

374
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:23,576
Unfortunately, Savage
has kept his movements

375
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:24,744
hidden throughout history.

376
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,012
Not even Gideon can determine

377
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,347
where or when we can find him.

378
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:30,483
But I have the next best thing:

379
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,285
the man who can.

380
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,653
Professor Aldus Boardman.

381
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,056
Professor Boardman is the world's
leading... well, only...

382
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,359
expert on Vandal Savage.

383
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,894
We're gonna pay him a little visit.

384
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:43,763
Course plotted for St.
Roch, New Orleans.

385
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:47,700
- St. Roch?
- October 17, 1975.

386
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:49,568
I suggest you all strap yourselves in.

387
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,205
Temporal navigation isn't
something one wants to be

388
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,140
standing up for.

389
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,681
Time travel. Cool.

390
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,517
Some of you may experience
some slight discomfort.

391
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,953
In very rare instances,
there will be some...

392
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:08,321
bleeding from the eyeballs.

393
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:10,656
I'm sorry, what?

394
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,195
The human body is used to
time unfolding linearly.

395
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,272
Jackson, I'm so glad you're awake.

396
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:27,606
I didn't want you to miss this.

397
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,442
Miss what?

398
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:32,979
What the...?

399
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,680
Oh, no, I wouldn't unfasten
those if I were you.

400
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:37,750
Get me off this...
whatever this thing is!

401
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:39,518
Good luck explaining this.

402
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
I did him a favor.

403
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:42,956
He doesn't look all that grateful.

404
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,025
Just hang on and remain calm.

405
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:51,564
All your worlds are about to change.

406
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,108
Seriously.

407
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,577
- That was insanity!
- God!

408
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,719
That is some serious
Darth Vader going on there.

409
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,321
Chronos to Command.

410
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:17,756
I am closing in on Captain
Hunter's position.

411
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,859
Hey, what you doing there, bro?

412
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,561
I am determining whether you
are integral to the timeline.

413
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:23,729
Okay.

414
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,232
You are not.

415
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:33,432
ST. ROCH
1975

416
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:47,887
Oh, I should have mentioned it before.

417
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:50,089
Nausea is one of the side
effects of time travel,

418
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:51,024
along with...

419
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,525
Vertigo.

420
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,527
- I can't see.
- And temporary blindness.

421
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:55,861
Oh, it should only last a minute.

422
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,663
After all, that was a mere jaunt.

423
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:00,033
The further back in time you go,
the worse the side effects.

424
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,401
- Better?
- It's all relative.

425
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:03,369
Good.

426
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:06,205
I can't believe you kidnapped me.

427
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,408
- Hey, I want to go home.
- Good news, then.

428
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,976
2016 will be around in... 41 years.

429
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,745
Now, you three, feel free to
make yourselves comfortable

430
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:14,580
back here on the ship,
while the rest of you

431
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,149
are coming with me to
find Professor Boardman.

432
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,420
- You're benching us?
- I thought we were a team.

433
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:23,011
This mission doesn't require
your particular skill set.

434
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:23,356
Yet.

435
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,824
Meaning you don't need anyone
killed, maimed, or robbed.

436
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,226
Precisely.

437
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:28,361
Sure it's a good idea
to leave these two

438
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:29,895
unsupervised on a time machine?

439
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,297
Hey, haircut!

440
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,199
Deafness wasn't one of the side effects.

441
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:34,300
We better hurry up.
Professor Boardman will die

442
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:35,768
in less than 24 hours.

443
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,103
What's the point in
cutting it so close?

444
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:38,771
Because if he's destined to die,

445
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,773
then he doesn't have a
timeline for us to disrupt,

446
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:43,276
and his impact on the
future will be minimal.

447
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:44,477
How brilliant.

448
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,678
And depressing.

449
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,012
How does he die?

450
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,014
He's found dead in his university

451
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,250
from unknown causes. Come on.

452
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:54,153
- Are you coming?
- I'll stay put.

453
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:55,988
You'd rather stay with them?

454
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,290
They didn't drug me.

455
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:58,791
Point taken.

456
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:03,529
This is unbelievable. 1975.

457
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,499
Imagine all the wondrous
applications of this technology.

458
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,235
A chance to witness the
construction of the pyramids,

459
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,137
the end of the dinosaurs.

460
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,905
I've never been to 1975.

461
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:14,474
It's rather colorful.

462
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:16,709
So, where can we find
Professor Boardman?

463
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,011
In his lecture hall.

464
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,690
Oh, man. We're too late.

465
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:34,727
This is... I'm, I'm sorry.

466
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:39,632
You.

467
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,000
Both of you.

468
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,735
You know who we are?

469
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:46,405
I've been studying you my whole life.

470
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,706
Ever since, as a child,

471
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,842
I first heard the story of Chay-Ara,

472
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:52,278
High Priestess of Horus, the Hawk God,

473
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,147
and her lover, Price Khufu.

474
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:58,284
I hoped and prayed this day might come.

475
00:22:58,286 --> 00:23:00,886
Well, then, looks like we've
come to the right place.

476
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:02,588
I'm sorry. Who are you?

477
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,190
A fellow historian,

478
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,992
here to discuss another
passion of yours:

479
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:10,329
Vandal Savage.

480
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,864
There's no way of telling your story

481
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:15,168
without telling his also.

482
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:20,005
Okay...

483
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:23,309
Why does this stupid station
play nothing but reruns?

484
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:25,378
Don't even bother trying to explain.

485
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,247
Am I the only one on this ship
who could really use a drink?

486
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:31,350
I say we go get weird in the '70s.

487
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:32,851
Excellent idea.

488
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,820
I got the perfect outfit.

489
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:36,755
Perhaps Captain Hunter was unclear

490
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:38,724
with his instructions to remain onboard.

491
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:40,359
Shut it, metal mouth.

492
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,028
Oh, you're not quite ready
to run with this crew.

493
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,564
Sorry, kid.

494
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,199
Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?

495
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:48,668
I said I'd take care of you.

496
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,704
4,000 years ago,

497
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:54,373
Vandal Savage was an Egyptian priest,

498
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,310
secretly in love with a priestess.

499
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,944
You.

500
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:00,513
Or, rather,

501
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,682
you in your first life.

502
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,253
But you were in love with another.

503
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:09,622
Prince Khufu.

504
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:12,858
Savage, or Hath-Set
as he was then known,

505
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
learned of the affair and was consumed

506
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:16,995
with jealous rage.

507
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,764
You believe me yet?

508
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:22,134
Which drove him to murder you both.

509
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:27,707
And prayed for the hawk god, Horus,

510
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:32,211
to damn the objects of his
hate for all eternity.

511
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:35,348
But Chay-Ara had a prayer of her own,

512
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,650
that Horus would protect them forever.

513
00:24:37,652 --> 00:24:40,453
But another life was bound
to theirs by accident.

514
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,787
Savage's.

515
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,922
That's why he wants us both dead.

516
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:45,424
My theory is that the three of you

517
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:47,760
were exposed to the same
radiation by the meteorites.

518
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:49,428
We all share the same power.

519
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,430
And every time he kills
you, it passes to him.

520
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:53,432
That's what maintains his immortality.

521
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,000
That's impossible.

522
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:57,303
Unless the meteorites
contained a mutative element,

523
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:59,438
like the particle accelerator
that caused your powers.

524
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,006
But without evidence, you're asking us

525
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:02,107
to take you at your word?

526
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,376
It's not my word.

527
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:04,677
It's theirs.

528
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,148
But you still don't remember me, do you?

529
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,351
We knew you in our past lives.

530
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:15,988
You've told me your entire story,

531
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,190
stretching back through the ages,

532
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:19,458
but when I first knew you,

533
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,728
it was after World War I,

534
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,631
and your names were Joe and Edith.

535
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:27,767
Edith Boardman.

536
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:31,570
Wait, I... we were related?

537
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:36,375
I don't remember you. I'm so sorry.

538
00:25:36,377 --> 00:25:37,777
Don't be.

539
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:39,978
You always warned me
that if I ran into you

540
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,447
in your next life,

541
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:44,082
you might have forgotten me.

542
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,452
That's us

543
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:50,022
at the World's Fair.

544
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,896
You're just as beautiful
as I remember you.

545
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:02,901
Mother.

546
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,844
How old were you when...

547
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:14,680
You two were murdered?

548
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,582
Ten.

549
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:18,183
My whole life, you
taught me to be careful,

550
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:19,585
to keep moving,

551
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:21,420
always one step ahead of Savage,

552
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:23,889
but after tracking you for 4,000 years,

553
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:25,591
he'd gotten good.

554
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:27,459
He found us in the middle of the night

555
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,829
at a fleabag motel in North Carolina.

556
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,664
You hid me in the closet,

557
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,000
made me promise that no
matter what I heard,

558
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:38,604
I'd stay put.

559
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:41,139
And I did.

560
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,642
Sorry to interrupt your family time,

561
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,243
but we were hoping you
could tell us a bit more

562
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:48,714
where to locate Savage's
present whereabouts.

563
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,285
He hides in the shadows,

564
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:56,688
never drawing too much attention,

565
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,056
but every lifetime,

566
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:00,692
placing himself near the seat of power,

567
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:03,962
sowing seeds of destruction.

568
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:05,597
Who remembers the name of the man

569
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,667
who whispered in the ear
of Gavrilo Princip,

570
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:12,438
and convinced him to start World War I?

571
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,172
Why? What does he get out of that?

572
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,308
The more the world is
focused on destroying itself,

573
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,978
the less it notices an immortal
psychopath in its midst.

574
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,750
With the ultimate goal of
subjugating the entire planet.

575
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:28,554
He killed your parents,
Professor Boardman.

576
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:32,724
Something tells me you know
where to locate Vandal Savage.

577
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:34,192
I have...

578
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,729
an educated guess.

579
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:43,969
Dollar beers.

580
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:46,071
You got to love the '70s.

581
00:27:46,073 --> 00:27:49,374
Who wants to listen to
some Captain and Tennille?

582
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,142
My mother played it.

583
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:53,211
A lot.

584
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:59,785
Wow, you guys are really far out.

585
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:03,989
- You want to dance, Leonard?
- You go right ahead.

586
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,357
I'll watch.

587
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:08,760
Suit yourself.

588
00:28:17,004 --> 00:28:18,937
Can I help you?

589
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:21,607
How about you join me
in the parking lot?

590
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:22,908
Tempting,

591
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,243
but you're not my type.

592
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,847
But your lady, on the other hand,

593
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:32,017
well, she looks just my speed.

594
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:33,852
Maybe you didn't
understand my request,

595
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:36,388
bitch.

596
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:39,224
Son of a...

597
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:40,526
I got this.

598
00:28:57,645 --> 00:29:00,579
Now I could stand for a little help.

599
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:18,964
I love the '70s.

600
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:23,468
Gideon. That is your name, right?

601
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,903
How may I help you?

602
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:26,872
I assume this ship has a...

603
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:28,173
autopilot or something?

604
00:29:28,175 --> 00:29:30,108
- You assume correctly.
- Great.

605
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,745
In that case, I'ma need you
to take me back to 2016.

606
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:36,014
See, me being here,
it's all a big mistake.

607
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:38,316
Captain Hunter told me
you'd try to do this,

608
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,652
and he also told me not to
listen to anything you say.

609
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,054
Well, you are a computer.

610
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:43,388
You have to listen to me!

611
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,856
You seem overwrought, Mr. Jackson.

612
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:46,491
If you'd like to go to the MedBay,

613
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,926
I'd be happy to prescribe
you a sedative.

614
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:50,829
I do not need another roofie!

615
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,798
What was that?

616
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,399
A thermite grenade.

617
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:57,202
It seems someone is trying
to breach the hull.

618
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:00,405
His name is Chronos.

619
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,841
He's a temporal bounty hunter.

620
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,410
The ship is taking heavy fire.

621
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,079
I know!

622
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:09,781
Aren't we supposed to be
invisible or something?

623
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:11,850
You need to get us out of here now!

624
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,785
A lifetime of research
on Vandal Savage

625
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,420
that all points in this direction.

626
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:17,089
This should help you find him,

627
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:20,058
and the vengeance that has
eluded me all these years.

628
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,960
Jefferson... something's
happening to Jefferson!

629
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:24,096
We seem to have a little
problem back a the...

630
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:25,597
vessel.

631
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,265
There's an intruder. We
really must be going now.

632
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,967
Thank you for everything.

633
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:30,168
Wait.

634
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,402
We can't just leave him here.

635
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:33,005
We have to get back now.

636
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:35,073
You said he's going
to die in 24 hours.

637
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:36,374
And we can stop it.

638
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,176
Are either of you a Time Master?

639
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:39,577
I didn't think so.

640
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,280
I've spent years studying
the implications

641
00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:43,381
of chronological alteration.

642
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,651
Good for you,

643
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:46,785
but we're not going anywhere

644
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:49,554
unless our son's coming with us.

645
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,793
Why is Chronos attacking us?

646
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:56,194
Perhaps Captain Hunter is best suited

647
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:57,529
to answer that query.

648
00:30:57,531 --> 00:30:59,097
Fire photon torpedoes or something!

649
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,033
Only Captain Hunter is authorized.

650
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:02,267
Where is Captain Hunter?

651
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,802
Dr. Palmer, please tell me...

652
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:05,771
I didn't leave my
exo-suit on the ship?

653
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:08,073
Okay, but I'd be lying.

654
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:26,158
Who the hell is this guy?

655
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:38,570
Is that a laser gun?

656
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,080
Gotta get back to the ship
and bond with Jefferson.

657
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:49,114
Cover me!

658
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,016
Cover me too.

659
00:31:56,824 --> 00:32:00,092
Oh, you crazy old man.

660
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,198
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

661
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,166
Seriously? It's Dr. Palmer.

662
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:10,501
Get down!

663
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:14,072
We need to merge!

664
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,514
We go out for one lousy drink,

665
00:32:23,516 --> 00:32:24,983
and you guys somehow manage

666
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,885
to pick a fight with Boba Fett.

667
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:47,705
- Aldus!
- We'll get you out of here!

668
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:49,809
SUBTITLES FROM TUSUBTITULO

669
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,110
You're doing good.

670
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:56,982
Professor Boardman has sustained

671
00:32:56,984 --> 00:32:58,516
severe internal injuries.

672
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,085
Prepare the MedBay to
receive Professor Boardman

673
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:01,019
and get us out of here!

674
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,154
Course heading?

675
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:05,290
Anywhere but here!

676
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:17,023
Our cloaking shield and aft entrance

677
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:19,091
have been significantly
compromised, Captain.

678
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:20,793
Yes, I can see that, Gideon.

679
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,662
Station us in the temporal
zone while I work on repairs.

680
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:24,030
Temporal zone?

681
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:25,998
Yeah, it's essentially a time limbo.

682
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,634
We can hide out there for a bit.

683
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:29,569
Another temporal jump would
risk revealing our position.

684
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:32,220
A time limbo? Astonishing.

685
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,260
Oh, there's something you people

686
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,374
don't know about time travel?

687
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,273
That's surprising, isn't it?

688
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:37,210
Considering none of you have
ever time traveled before.

689
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:38,645
Bringing a family member from the past

690
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,213
onto a timeship?

691
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:42,448
Breaking out and carousing
around the 1970s?

692
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,450
We've barely begun, and
already this is the worst,

693
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:47,787
unmitigated disaster of my career.

694
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:51,558
I see why you got the hots for that one.

695
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,826
My son is hurt because of you.

696
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:55,428
Who attacked us?

697
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,198
Something of a long story.

698
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,600
Better tell it fast, Rip,
'cause it doesn't look like

699
00:34:00,602 --> 00:34:03,035
the lady's in a patient mood.

700
00:34:03,037 --> 00:34:05,871
Neither am I.

701
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:07,139
His name is Chronos.

702
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:10,976
He works for the Council
of Time Masters.

703
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:15,281
My former employers.

704
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,450
I thought you were a Time Master.

705
00:34:17,452 --> 00:34:20,152
As I've expressed,
time's not a linear thing.

706
00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:23,323
At some point I was, in
fact, a Time Master.

707
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,458
Will you people please stop hitting me?

708
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,761
Start telling the truth!

709
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:30,330
I relinquished my
position as a Time Master

710
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:32,965
when I commandeered the Waverider.

711
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:35,301
Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.

712
00:34:35,303 --> 00:34:37,270
- You lied to us.
- Of course I lied to you.

713
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:40,005
I needed your help... you all
barely said yes as it was.

714
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:42,408
What about the legends part?

715
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:45,878
You lied about
that too, didn't you?

716
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:49,949
I chose you all because,
a hundred years from now,

717
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:54,554
your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

718
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:59,225
I needed your help without
disturbing the history of 2166.

719
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:04,029
So, we're like the
opposite of legends.

720
00:35:04,031 --> 00:35:07,367
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't kill you.

721
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,269
Ditto the arsonist.

722
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:10,637
Because Gideon wouldn't
listen to your commands

723
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,305
and you'd be stuck here forever.

724
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:14,206
Great, so we're not
an elite team of heroes

725
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,875
on a sanctioned mission,
sent to rid the future

726
00:35:15,877 --> 00:35:17,377
of its most horrific bad guy.

727
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:19,211
Just a collection of nobodies

728
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:21,414
who time really doesn't
give a damn about.

729
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:24,517
I didn't lie about the mission itself.

730
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,387
Or the brutality and
ruthlessness of Savage.

731
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:28,888
Or my need for your help.

732
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,523
I don't imagine you're the kind of guy

733
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:32,958
who quits his job and takes
on this kind of threat

734
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,727
for altruistic reasons,

735
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:37,229
so Rip, why don't you tell us:

736
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:41,401
what did Vandal Savage do to you?

737
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:45,538
The Time Masters discourage marriage.

738
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,940
They urg uagainst procreation even more.

739
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:50,142
A Time Master should be free
of any personal entanglements

740
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,913
that might compromise him.

741
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:55,815
But...

742
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:58,551
I fell in love,

743
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:02,755
and we had a child.

744
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,990
A boy.

745
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,827
Jonas.

746
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:39,359
Savage killed your family.

747
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:42,528
He slaughtered my family.

748
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,330
And thousands of other families.

749
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,499
And that body that I
swore an oath to serve

750
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,535
turned a blind eye.

751
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:52,805
They continue to turn a blind eye.

752
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:54,540
I won't.

753
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,576
The last thing that my
child saw in this world

754
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:58,745
was that monster's face.

755
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:00,813
You can be damn well sure
that when Savage dies,

756
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:03,916
the last face he sees will be mine.

757
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:05,117
I understand, given the circumstances,

758
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,619
if you wish to return home.

759
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:08,421
We can make the jump once
the repairs are done,

760
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:12,592
if and when Professor
Boardman stabilizes.

761
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:19,399
I think we all need a little time

762
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:23,035
to consider our options.

763
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:37,163
Just get some rest.

764
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,535
There's something I've
wanted you to have.

765
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:46,172
It's around my neck.

766
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:57,617
It was my mother's.

767
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:00,520
Yours.

768
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:03,723
It's beautiful.

769
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:07,293
I remember it.

770
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:29,949
Thank you.

771
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:31,917
Rip wouldn't have allowed
me to bring Aldus onboard

772
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:32,985
if you hadn't said so...

773
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:35,054
Of course.

774
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:40,059
Chay-Ara...

775
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:41,794
sorry.

776
00:38:41,796 --> 00:38:43,729
Kendra.

777
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:46,666
No, it's okay.

778
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:50,303
Chay-Ara is fine.

779
00:38:58,146 --> 00:39:01,080
Seems an apology is in order.

780
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:02,549
What I did was wrong.

781
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:05,017
I should never have
forced you to come along.

782
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:07,287
But, for me, the opportunity

783
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:10,256
to travel through time,

784
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:12,592
see the mysteries of
the universe revealed,

785
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:15,895
notions I've spent my
whole life studying...

786
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:18,531
Please do not geek out on
quantum physics right now.

787
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:22,602
Mr. Hunter was offering
grand adventure.

788
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:23,903
And at my age, you never know

789
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,439
how many adventures you have left.

790
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:27,940
Hey,

791
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:30,142
I saw your 40-yard dash onto the ship

792
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,345
with that Chronos guy shooting at you.

793
00:39:32,347 --> 00:39:36,148
I think you got plenty
of adventures left.

794
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,451
Yes, perhaps you're right.

795
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:41,921
Back home. As Firestorm.

796
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,556
What if I don't want to go home?

797
00:39:43,558 --> 00:39:45,625
Yet, I mean.

798
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:48,695
Why the change of heart?

799
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:50,996
You ever play football?

800
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:53,899
Yeah, I didn't think so.

801
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:56,969
Anyway... the best feeling

802
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:58,671
I ever got from being on the field

803
00:39:58,673 --> 00:40:00,406
wasn't when I made a great play,

804
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:02,308
or we won some game.

805
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,844
It was when one of my teammates
took a tackle for me,

806
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:08,047
and I knew they were gonna
make sure I was safe,

807
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:10,950
that nobody got to me.

808
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:12,985
Watching all of you
rush back to the ship,

809
00:40:12,987 --> 00:40:14,987
even those two knuckleheads,

810
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:17,423
to take on Chronos?

811
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:20,326
Made me feel the same way.

812
00:40:20,328 --> 00:40:23,429
I like being part of a team, man.

813
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:28,167
Me too.

814
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,339
Watch it!

815
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:35,275
Sorry.

816
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:37,109
Sorry.

817
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:43,015
What's the point of us even
giving this a second thought?

818
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:44,517
Rip has already seen the future.

819
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,120
He knows exactly what's
in store for each of us.

820
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:50,556
Might as well have stayed dead,

821
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:52,625
'cause the world doesn't need any of us.

822
00:40:52,627 --> 00:40:54,427
You're just a lost assassin.

823
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:57,062
You're just a pair of
good-for-nothing criminals.

824
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:58,898
I can live with that.

825
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,200
Well, I can't.

826
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:04,704
Can't live with somebody
putting a cap on my destiny.

827
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:08,741
Spent my whole life working
to be something greater

828
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:11,511
by becoming something smaller.

829
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,912
Then some guy comes along and tells me

830
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:15,915
that being the Atom is as insignificant

831
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:17,950
as an actual Atom.

832
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:21,387
That's not what he said.

833
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:24,557
Rip said that in his future

834
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,426
we're nobodies,

835
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:30,229
but this mission is about
changing the future.

836
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:33,366
I mean, if we have the
power to change the world,

837
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:37,136
don't you think we have the
power to change our own fate?

838
00:41:38,272 --> 00:41:41,307
For better or for worse.

839
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:43,576
That's a very good point.

840
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:49,114
What do you think, Gideon?

841
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:51,451
I calculate a less than 6% likelihood

842
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:52,785
that they decide to go
on with the mission.

843
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:54,454
I meant about the repairs.

844
00:41:54,456 --> 00:41:56,389
And there has been another
unfortunate consequence

845
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,790
of Chronos's attack.

846
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:00,460
- Care to hear about it?
- Not really.

847
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:02,829
He's gone.

848
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:09,635
Our son... or, our son
from our previous life.

849
00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:12,605
It's all too confusing.

850
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,139
I'm very sorry.

851
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:16,976
Actually, you don't
get the blame for this.

852
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:18,611
This was my fault.

853
00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:20,413
If I hadn't insisted on
bringing him back here,

854
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:22,915
he might have died peacefully,
in his sleep maybe.

855
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:25,017
Don't torture yourself
with recriminations.

856
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:26,386
One of the gat lessons of time travel

857
00:42:26,388 --> 00:42:28,120
is that many things cannot be changed.

858
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:29,756
Time wants to happen.

859
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:33,292
Chronos, even Vandal, won't
be the only enemy we face.

860
00:42:33,294 --> 00:42:36,729
Very often, it will be time itself.

861
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:38,264
Whether it wants to happen or not,

862
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:39,331
we're gonna change time,

863
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,733
erase Savage's future,

864
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:42,602
and earn our rightful place in history.

865
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:44,069
Dr. Palmer is correct.

866
00:42:44,071 --> 00:42:45,938
We may not be legends
in your time, Captain,

867
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,876
but we are going to
decide our own fates.

868
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:52,211
I don't give a damn
about being a legend,

869
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:55,080
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

870
00:42:55,082 --> 00:42:57,216
I can get down with that.

871
00:42:57,218 --> 00:42:59,218
And our malcontents?

872
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,787
I like killing people.

873
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,388
We're in.

874
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,356
For now.

875
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,393
So how do we find this guy?

876
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:09,995
Professor Boardman had
a theory about that.

877
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:12,231
I've already had Gideon plot a course.

878
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:19,138
NORWAY 1975

879
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,479
You know what this is?

880
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:30,382
An instrument to make this
world a better place.

881
00:43:30,384 --> 00:43:33,252
History teaches us that
the cause of humanity

882
00:43:33,254 --> 00:43:36,556
is only advanced through strife.

883
00:43:36,558 --> 00:43:40,392
There's no Renaissance
without the Dark Ages.

884
00:43:40,394 --> 00:43:43,329
Man had no interest
in splitting the atom

885
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:46,432
until World War II.

886
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:50,770
I'm just trying

887
00:43:50,772 --> 00:43:54,807
to make this world a better place,

888
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:57,510
one war at a time.
